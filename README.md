## 1. About The Project <a id='sec1'></a>

This project is a part of the repositories to illustrate my software engineering experience.
This repository especially demonstrates my skills about the software design.

In the first section, I will start by describing the problem without diving into too much detail.
Then, I will define the requirements, the limitations and the assumptions for the requested software.

Finally, I will discuss on the issues related to the design and architecture.

**CAUTION**\
**This project defines only the core framework of a structural analysis application (SAA).**
**The other components (e.g. the UI) are excluded intensionally as I am not a frontend developer.**
**However, I was involved such a project previously and implemented the UI and graphics interface using javascript with the help of Claude AI.**

## 2. Problem Definition: Stress Analysis of the Structural Components <a id='sec2'></a>

There exist mainly two approaches in the anaysis/inspection of the structural components (SCs):
1. The analytical approach to inspect the SCs mainly based on the principles of *the strength of materials*, *fracture mechanics*, etc.
2. The finite element (FE) approach to inspect the SCs based on the numerical methods

The former relies on the theoretical and experimental rules and data while 
the later performs numerical calculations based on some primitive physical laws.
In other words, the FE approach relies on the power of the computers
in order to replace the complex formulation of the analytical analysis with simple definitions.
Having a simple formulation, the FE analysis can be applied on any problem **uniformly**.
However, the cost of the uniform analysis interface is the requirement for a large computation power.
In other words, an inspection handled in a few miliseconds by the analytical approach may take hours by an FE solver.
Additionally, the FE approach contains some inevitable assumptions which results with the loss of the accuracy.

The **target software** aims to serve a *closed form stand-alone* solution for the analytical approach.
This project defines the **framework** which would support the target software.

Additionally, there are three terms which will be used frequently in this document:
- **Reserve Factor (RF):** A unitless value to measure the structural analysis result (SAR): the current stiffness / the critical stiffness
- **Inspection:** The procedure to find the RF value of an SC for a given failure mode (FM)
- **Sizing:** The procedure to determine the required properties of an SC to have an acceptable RF

The target software should be capable of performing both of the inspection and the sizing procedures.

## 3. Software Design: Requirements, Limitations & Assumptions <a id='sec3'></a>

**The Target Market**\
The SAs are performed on the structural components, SCs (e.g. panel) against a number of the failure modes, FMs (e.g. buckling).
The variaty of the SCs and the FMs depends on the industry.
In the history, the SAs have been performed using simple tools like excel which was satisfactory for small business.
Excel provides an efficient computation capability and traceability in such a case.
However, excel becomes useless when the variaty and the number of the data gets large.
Besides, the size of the engineering team is another parameter due to the role definitions.
This application is the candidate to take place of excel in such conditions.
In other words, the target customers is the large companies with projects containing large variaty of SCs managed by large teams of engineers.
Hence, we can underline three points about the application:
- **[Note 1]:** The application should manage large data
- **[Note 2]:** The application should manage the configuration issues
- **[Note 3]:** The application should manage the aspects of the multi-user model

Additional to the above three, there is one more important point.
The large companies in the industry have their own methods for the SAs and they dont want this data to be public.
Hence, they would like to embed their methods into the application themselves.
This requires a plugin based software where the development of the structural analysis methods/modules (SAMMs) is left to the customer.
Additionally, the companies may assign a team of structural engineers instead of the software engineers for the plugin development.
This is quite common in the industry as the engineers are equipped with some level of software development skills.
Hence, the design of the plugins must allow fast and easy development for the SAMMs:
- **[Note 4]:** A plugin based application in terms of the SAMMs
- **[Note 5]:** Define only the framework and leave SAMMs to the customer -> assume python for the SAMMs as it is the most well-known language

Next, I will go through the use-case, the process flow and the activity diagrams.

### 3.1. Use Case Diagram <a id='sec31'></a>

- **Primary Actor:** SAE
- **Scope:** SAA
- **Level:** User goal  

#### 3.1.1. Stakeholders and Interests
- **SAE**: wants to inspect the SCs under the FE extracted loads.
- **Project Manager**: needs quick feedback on the analysis status.

#### 3.1.2. Preconditions
- an existing FE data pack with a predefined format including the geometry, material and loading exists.

#### 3.1.3. Scenarios

There are mainly two use case scenarios:
1. Zero-to-end scenario including the FE import
2. DAG-to-end scenario where an existing DAG is requested to run SAMMs

I will demonstrate the former scenario.
The later requires an existing DAG which is an issue related to the IO algorithms.

**Main Flow**
1. **SAE** selects to import an FE data with a predefined format.
2. **UI** emits an event to activate the system for the FE data extraction.
3. **System** creates the DAG corresponding to the FE data and links the DAG to the FE.
4. **System** emits an event to initialize the user forms and the graphics.
5. **UI** initializes the user forms and the graphics.
6. **SAE** selects the analysis dataset (i.e. SCs, LCs and SAMMs) from the component tree.
7. **SAE** clicks **Run Analysis** to execute the SAs for the selected analysis dataset.
8. **UI** emits an event to activate the system for an analysis request with the selected dataset.
9. **System** retrieves the FE data from the DAG corresponding to the requested dataset.
10. **System** executes the SAMMs with the requested dataset.
11. **System** creates the SAR nodes in the DAG and links them to the requested dataset.
12. **System** updates the states of the SCs as **up-to-date**.
13. **System** emits an event to activate the UI for the states and SARs.
14. **UI** refreshes the component tree for the state of the selected dataset as **up-to-date**.

**Alternate Flows (Errors) - 1: Error during FE import**
- **3 System** terminates the the FE Import.
- **4 System** logs an error and sets the status to **Error**.
- **5 System** emits an event to activate the UI to display the error message for the import failure.
- **6 UI** displays the error message for the import failure.

**Alternate Flows (Errors) - 2: Missing data (the analysis dataset is incomplete)**
- **9 System** terminates the SAMM run.
- **10 System** emits an event to activate the UI to display the error message for the missing dataset.
- **11 UI** displays the error message for the missing dataset.

**Alternate Flows (Errors) - 3: The computation fails**
- **11 System** logs an error for the erroneous SA.
- **12 System** sets status to **Error**.
- **13 System** waits until the remainning SAs finishes.
- **14 System** emits an event to activate the UI to act for the successful and failed SAs correspondingly.
- **15 UI** updates the RFs in the form of the active SC if not erroneous.
- **16 UI** refreshes the component tree for the state of the selected dataset as **up-to-date** and as **failed** correspondingly.
- **17 UI** displays the error message for the erroneous SA.

#### 3.1.4. Postconditions
- The SAR nodes for the successful SAs exist in the DAG.
- The RF in the current user form has the latest value if not erroneous.
- UI reflects the updated state data.

5. **System** creates a **BucklingResult** node and links it to the panel.
6. **System** updates the panel‚Äôs status to **Up-To-Date**.
7. **UI** refreshes: RFs in the panel form update, and the panel‚Äôs tree node turns green.

##### 4. Extensions (Alternate Flows)
- **3a. Missing LoadCase**  
  - If no load case is assigned, **System** prompts the engineer to select or create one.
- **4a. Analysis Error**  
  - If the computation fails, **System** logs an error, sets status to **Error**, and displays a message.

##### 5. Postconditions
- A **BucklingResult** exists in the DAG.
